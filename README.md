# SnapaNote
This app is targeted at students.
An Android app which organises your Notes!

You can add your modules and then snap some pictures of the notes and they will be automatically saved to your modules.
Everything is connected to the Firebase Database and Firebase Storage so the user won't lose data when he loses his phone etc.
This app includes an autocrop tool which detects notes! You can also apply different filters to make the note clearer.
I have included student article recommendations, so that when a student adds a module, lets say "Programming", the app will look for the best and the latest article about Programming using NewsAPI. 


This app is built using a ScanLibrary https://github.com/jhansireddy/AndroidScannerDemo
